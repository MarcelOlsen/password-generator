# Password Generator

This project is a web-based password generator built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It allows users to generate secure passwords with customizable options.

Finished this project after a I forgot about it. Based on the [FrontendMentor excercise](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/password-generator-app-Mr8CLycqjh). Glad I finally have a frontend-ish project to show. Also really cool it's actually kind of useful for the everyday user!
